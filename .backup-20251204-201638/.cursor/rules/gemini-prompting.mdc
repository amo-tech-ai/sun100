# Gemini AI Prompting Best Practices

**Purpose:** Guide for creating effective prompts for Google Gemini AI models  
**Source:** Based on official Gemini API prompt design documentation  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-16

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Clear and Specific Instructions
- Provide explicit instructions in the form of questions, step-by-step tasks, or user experience mapping
- Be specific about what you want the model to do
- Use constraints to limit scope and format

### 2. Input Types
- **Question Input:** Direct questions that require answers
- **Task Input:** Specific tasks the model should perform
- **Entity Input:** Entities the model operates on
- **Completion Input:** Partial content for the model to complete

### 3. Response Format Specification
- Always specify desired output format (table, list, JSON, paragraph, etc.)
- Use output prefixes (e.g., "JSON:", "Answer:") to guide format
- Provide examples of the desired format

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### Always Use Few-Shot Examples
- **Critical:** Always include 2-5 examples showing the desired pattern
- Few-shot prompts are significantly more effective than zero-shot
- Examples can replace instructions if they're clear enough
- Use consistent formatting across all examples

### Add Context
- Include all necessary information the model needs
- Don't assume the model has domain-specific knowledge
- Provide constraints, details, and background information
- Reference specific documents, guides, or data when relevant

### Use Prefixes Strategically
- **Input Prefixes:** Label different parts of input (e.g., "English:", "French:")
- **Output Prefixes:** Signal expected format (e.g., "JSON:", "Answer:")
- **Example Prefixes:** Label examples in few-shot prompts for easier parsing

### Break Down Complex Prompts
- Split complex instructions into simpler components
- Chain prompts for sequential tasks
- Aggregate responses for parallel operations
- One prompt per instruction when possible

## 📋 Prompt Structure Template

```
[Context/Background Information]
[Clear Instructions]
[Constraints]
[Few-Shot Examples (2-5 examples)]
[Input Prefix] [Actual Input]
[Output Prefix]
```

## 🎨 Example Patterns

### Pattern 1: Task with Few-Shot Examples
```
You are an expert pitch deck editor. Based on the examples below, rewrite slide content to be more investor-focused.

Example 1:
Input: "Our product has many features"
Output: "Our platform delivers 3 core value propositions that directly address investor ROI concerns"

Example 2:
Input: "We have customers"
Output: "We've validated product-market fit with 500+ paying customers and 95% retention"

Now rewrite: [user input]
```

### Pattern 2: Structured Output with Prefixes
```
Classify the following slide titles into categories: [vision, problem, solution, market, traction]

Text: "The Future of AI-Powered Presentations"
Category: vision

Text: "Founders Waste 60+ Hours on Pitch Decks"
Category: problem

Text: [user input]
Category:
```

### Pattern 3: Completion Strategy
```
Generate 5 headline variations for a pitch deck vision slide.

Original Title: "AI Pitch Deck Tool"

Headlines:
1. 
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Use zero-shot prompts without examples
- Assume the model knows domain-specific context
- Use vague instructions without constraints
- Mix inconsistent formatting in examples
- Rely on models for factual information without verification
- Use anti-patterns (showing what NOT to do)

### ✅ Do This Instead:
- Always include 2-5 few-shot examples
- Provide all necessary context explicitly
- Use clear constraints and format specifications
- Maintain consistent formatting across examples
- Use positive patterns (show what TO do)
- Verify factual information independently

---

## 🔧 Model Parameters

### Temperature
- **Low (0-0.3):** Deterministic, factual responses
- **Medium (0.4-0.7):** Balanced creativity and accuracy
- **High (0.8-1.0):** Creative, diverse responses

**Recommendation:** Use low temperature (0.2-0.4) for structured outputs, medium (0.5-0.7) for creative content

### Max Output Tokens
- 100 tokens ≈ 60-80 words
- Set based on expected response length
- Leave buffer for longer responses

### Top-K & Top-P
- **Top-K:** Number of most probable tokens to consider
- **Top-P:** Cumulative probability threshold
- Default Top-P: 0.95
- Lower values = more focused, higher = more diverse

---

## 🎯 Prompt Iteration Strategy

### When Results Don't Match Expectations:

1. **Rephrase the Prompt**
   - Try different wording
   - Use synonyms
   - Change sentence structure

2. **Switch to Analogous Task**
   - If direct instruction fails, use similar task
   - Example: Instead of "categorize", use "multiple choice"

3. **Change Content Order**
   - Try: [examples] → [context] → [input]
   - Try: [input] → [examples] → [context]
   - Try: [examples] → [input] → [context]

4. **Adjust Temperature**
   - If getting fallback responses, increase temperature
   - If too creative, decrease temperature

## 📝 Prompt Checklist

Before sending a prompt to Gemini, verify:

- [ ] Clear, specific instructions provided
- [ ] 2-5 few-shot examples included
- [ ] Consistent formatting across examples
- [ ] Output format specified
- [ ] Necessary context included
- [ ] Constraints clearly stated
- [ ] Prefixes used appropriately (if needed)
- [ ] Temperature set appropriately for task
- [ ] Max output tokens set correctly

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### For Structured Outputs (JSON, Tables, Lists)
```
[Context]
[2-3 Examples showing exact format]
[Input Prefix] [User Input]
[Output Prefix]
Temperature: 0.2-0.4
```

### For Creative Content (Headlines, Descriptions)
```
[Context]
[2-3 Examples showing style/tone]
[Constraints]
[User Input]
Temperature: 0.5-0.7
```

### For Analysis Tasks
```
[Context with relevant information]
[Examples showing analysis format]
[Input to analyze]
[Output format specification]
Temperature: 0.3-0.5
```

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Few-shot > Zero-shot:** Always include examples
2. **Positive patterns > Negative patterns:** Show what TO do, not what NOT to do
3. **Context is critical:** Don't assume model knowledge
4. **Format matters:** Consistent formatting in examples = consistent output
5. **Temperature matters:** Lower for structured, higher for creative
6. **Iteration is normal:** Expect to refine prompts 2-3 times

## 🎯 Application to Sun AI Project

### When Creating Prompts for:
- **Deck Generation:** Use few-shot examples of good pitch decks
- **Slide Rewriting:** Show 2-3 examples of before/after transformations
- **Chart Generation:** Provide examples of chart data structures
- **Research:** Include context about credible sources and citation format
- **Analysis:** Show examples of clarity/impact/tone ratings

### Example: Slide Content Rewriting
```
You are an expert pitch deck editor. Rewrite slide content to be more investor-focused, following these examples:

Example 1:
Original: "Our product has many features"
Rewritten: "Our platform delivers 3 core value propositions that directly address investor ROI concerns"

Example 2:
Original: "We have customers"
Rewritten: "We've validated product-market fit with 500+ paying customers and 95% retention"

Now rewrite this slide content:
Title: [slide title]
Content: [slide content]

Output format: Return JSON with "newTitle" and "newContent" fields.
```

**Remember:** The best prompts are clear, specific, and include examples. When in doubt, add more context and examples.
